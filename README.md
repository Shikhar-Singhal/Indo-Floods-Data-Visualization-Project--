# Indo-Floods-Data-Visualization-Project--
This project presents a comprehensive suite of interactive analyses and visual representations derived from the extensive Indo-Floods dataset, encompassing river gauge measurements, flood levels, and related hydrological data across multiple Indian states. Flood events are critical indicators for assessing regional water dynamics, advancing disaster management strategies, and evaluating climate impact. The dataset spans a fifty-year period, from 1970 to 2020, providing a robust temporal framework for analyzing flood phenomena and hydrological trends over time.
